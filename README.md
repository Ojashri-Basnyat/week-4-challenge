JavaScript Code Quiz

A timed quiz on JS fundamentals that stores high scores and deducts time, when an incorrect answer is chosen. 

Created a 4 page application; First page is the introduction to the quiz style, quiz timer rules, play button & highscores button. The High Scores button takes you to the
Second page that displays all the highscores and the names of those players, if the players have saved their scores & names. 

Third page is the quiz page, that has a progress bar that shows you how far along the player is in the quiz, the player's score, the timer & the question with its choices. 

Fourth page is the last (end) page that shows the player their result, and where you can input your name, and store your score. It also has a start again button that takes the player to page two if the player wants to re-do the quiz, and a Go Home button that takes the player to the first page where the player can either take the quiz again or click on the highscores button to check the highscores of other players.

Functions used in .js files: 
- startGame : when the play clicks start button
- getNewQuestion : shows new questions from the four inputted questions
- incrementScore : to calculate the progress of the play using math 
- countdown : timer that shows how much time the player has to finish the quiz
- saveHighScore : to save the score a player gets in local storage
